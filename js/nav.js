  /* ----------------------------------------------------------- The sidebar

     One sidebar, every role. Admin was a flat ungrouped list of eleven items, HR had
     eight groups and the employee workspace nine — seven of those holding a single
     item, which is a flat list wearing a group's clothes. Three roles, three shapes,
     so learning where a module lives in one taught you nothing about the next.

     The plan below is the shape, and every role is built from it: the same groups in
     the same order, each slot in the same position, under the same label and icon.
     What varies by role is which slots it has at all — a slot a role has no module for
     is simply absent, and a group left empty does not draw. That is the part that
     should differ by role; where a thing sits, and what it is called, is not.

     A slot names the item path it fills, because the screens behind it belong to the
     role: HR's Employees is the roster, an employee's is their own record, and both
     belong in People under the same word. `path` is the usual case, where every role
     that has the slot reaches it by the same path; `as` is for the rest. The item
     bodies — tabs, sections, notes — stay in the per-role lists above, so the route
     table is exactly what it was before the sidebar was standardized.

     The labels lost their possessives on the way in. `My payroll` beside HR's
     `Payroll` is two names for one place in the structure, and the workspace already
     says whose data it is. */
